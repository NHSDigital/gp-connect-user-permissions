  Contains the permissions the patient has to their medical record and prescriptions services.

  Each permission has one property, `accessLevel`

  `accessLevel` describes the current level of permission
  the patient has.

  Medical record access levels are split into `current` and
  `historical` with an `effectiveDate` for when the current
  access level started. This is to account for allowing patients to access
  their future medical record entries. For more details, see
  [access to patient records through the NHS App](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-guidance-for-gp-practices/guidance-on-nhs-app-features/accelerating-patient-access-to-their-record).

  An optional array of `requests` may be included to contain information about
  any pending requests. This is information that should be displayed to the
  patient to help them understand the status of their requests.
