    ## Overview

    ![GP Connect Patient Facing User Permissions API Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/gp-connect-user-permissions/master/specification/diagrams/overview.svg)

    Use this API to list and manage the permissions a patient has to their
    medical record and a selection of services provided at their GP practice.

    You can:
    
    - get a patient's permissions

    You cannot:

    - change a patient's permissions

    To use this API, the end user must be a patient who is:

    - registered with the GP practice
    - registered with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    This API allows you to manage the permissions for:

    - prescriptions
    - medical record

    This API is designed to respect the policy changes made in order to
    allow patients to access their future medical record entries.
    For more details, see
    [access to patient records through the NHS App](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-guidance-for-gp-practices/guidance-on-nhs-app-features/accelerating-patient-access-to-their-record).

    ## Who can use this API

    This API:

    - is only for use by patient-facing applications
    - can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your
    development. To do this, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    You must do this before you can go live (see
    [Onboarding](#api-description__onboarding) below).

    ## API status and roadmap

    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:

    - it is available for testing in the sandbox environment
    - it is not available for production use
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    To see our roadmap or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/341390/gp-connect-user-permissions).

    If you have any other queries,
    [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level

    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year but
    only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday
    excluding bank holidays.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology

    This API is
    [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    ### Resources

    Use the [GP Connect User Management Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/GP-Connect-Patient-Facing-User-Management/Home?version=current) to assit with your integration.

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the
    [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details, see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API is
    [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:

    - a patient
    - authenticated with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    The API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to
    authorise the calling system. It supports the following security pattern
    using NHS login:

    - [User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    ### Sandbox testing

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    - is for early developer testing
    - only covers a limited set of scenarios
    - is stateless, so it does not store data
    - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our
    "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    
    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

    ### Integration testing (not yet available)

    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    - is for formal integration testing
    - is stateful, so it does persist data
    - includes authorisation

    For more details see
     [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding

    This API is not yet available for onboarding.

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded
    or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an
      API that needs to wait for further action

    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under
    Response. See our
    [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
    for more on errors.

        ## Overview

        Get a patient's permissions. The permissions describe the level of
        access the patient has to their medical record and the prescriptions service provided at their GP practice.

        The medical record permission includes the access level the patient
        has to both their current and their historical medical record.
        The prescriptions service permissions represent the
        patient's current access level.

        ## Use cases

        Use cases covered by this endpoint include:

        * building a UI so only the elements the patient has access to are
          available
        * presenting permissions to the patient so they can see what they do
          and do not have access to
