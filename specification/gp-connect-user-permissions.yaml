    ## Overview

    ![GP Connect Patient Facing User Permissions API Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/gp-connect-user-permissions/master/specification/diagrams/overview.svg)

    Use this API to list and manage the permissions a patient has to their
    medical record and a selection of services provided at their GP practice.

    You can:
    
    - get a patient's permissions
    - request to update a patient's permissions to a higher level

    You cannot:

    - request to update a patient's permissions to a lower level

    To use this API, the end user must be a patient who is:

    - registered with the GP practice
    - registered with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    This API allows you to manage the permissions for:

    - appointments
    - prescriptions
    - medical record

    This API is designed to respect the policy changes made in order to
    allow patients to access their future medical record entries.
    For more details, see
    [access to patient records through the NHS App](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-guidance-for-gp-practices/guidance-on-nhs-app-features/accelerating-patient-access-to-their-record).

    ## Who can use this API

    This API:

    - is only for use by patient-facing applications
    - can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your
    development. To do this, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    You must do this before you can go live (see
    [Onboarding](#api-description__onboarding) below).

    ## API status and roadmap

    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:

    - it is available for testing in the sandbox environment
    - it is not available for production use
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    To see our roadmap or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/341390/gp-connect-user-permissions).

    If you have any other queries,
    [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level

    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but
    only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday
    excluding bank holidays.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology

    This API is
    [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the
    [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API is
    [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:

    - a patient
    - authenticated with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    The API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to
    authorise the calling system. It supports the following security pattern
    using NHS login:

    ### Sandbox testing

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    - is for early developer testing
    - only covers a limited set of scenarios
    - is stateless, so it does not store data
    - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our
    "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    
    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

    ## Onboarding

    This API is not yet available for onboarding.

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded
    or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an
      API that needs to wait for further action

    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under
    Response. See our
    [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
    for more on errors.

      summary: Get a patient's permissions
      description: |
        ## Overview

        Get a patient's permissions. The permissions describe the level of
        access the patient has to their medical record, the appointments
        service and the prescriptions service provided at their GP practice.

        The medical record permission includes the access level the patient
        has to both their current and their historical medical record.
        The appointments and prescriptions service permissions represent the
        patient's current access level.

        ## Use cases

        Use cases covered by this endpoint include:

        * building a UI so only the elements the patient has access to are
          available
        * presenting permissions to the patient so they can see what they do
          and do not have access to
        * presenting permissions to the patient so they can request additional
          permissions

        ## Maximum allowable permissions

        Not all patients are able to request the highest level of
        permission available. The maximum level each patient can request is
        included within the response. This can be used to prevent patients
        requesting additional permissions that would not be granted.

        ## Pending requests

        It is possible for a patient to request to change permissions and
        those requests to not be actioned immediately. When this happens
        there is a need to inform the patient of any pending requests. This
        can be done using the `requests` property.

      summary: Request a change to a patient's permission
      description: |
        ## Overview

        Request a change to the permission a patient has for their medical
        record or services provided by the GP practice.

        Once you submit a request, it waits in a queue to be processed by a
        healthcare worker. Exactly when this will happen is unpredictable.

        The response to getting patient permissions contains information on
        pending requests. Once the request is processed it is no longer
        included in pending requests.

        If you like, you can share this information with the patient to help
        set their expectations.

        ## Use cases

        Use cases covered by this endpoint include the patient requesting:

        * additional access to the appointments
        * additional access to the prescriptions
        * additional access to their current medical record
        * detailed coded record access to their historical medical record

        ## Request workflow

        When a request is made, if it is accepted, it is added to the GP
        system's workflow and processed at some point in the future. Responses
        to these requests have a state of pending.

        Rejected requests are not added to the GP system's
        workflow. The message included in the response to a rejected request
        explains the reason for the rejection. This should be displayed to
        the patient.

        ## Request handling

        If a request is a duplicate, it is deduplicated by
        the GP system, with the original request being preserved.

        If multiple requests are made (and accepted) they are combined
        within the workflow and reviewed together by a healthcare worker.
